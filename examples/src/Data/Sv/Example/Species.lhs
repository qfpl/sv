module Data.Sv.Example.Species where

import Control.Lens ((&), (.~))
import Data.ByteString (ByteString)
import System.Exit (exitFailure)

import Data.Sv
import qualified Data.Sv.Decode as D

\end{code}

Here is our test file, in comma-separated-values format. Its subject is
the conservation statuses of species found in Queensland, Australia.
attributions.md describes how this file was sourced.

The file contains a header row featuring the column names, and then
thousands of rows of data. We will load the file from disk, parse it, and
then decode each row into a regular Haskell datatype, which will be
collected in a list.

It is important to mention that this file is encoded using Windows-1252,
which is a non-ISO extension to latin1 8-bit ASCII. In particular, it is
incompatible with UTF-8.

\begin{code}
file :: FilePath
file = "csv/species.csv"
\end{code}

The parser needs some configuration to parse our file. For example, it
needs to know which separator character we're using - in our case: comma.
We set up our config by modifying the default options using lens, but you
could just as easily modify it with record syntax, or build a config from
scratch using the types and values defined in Data.Sv.Parse.Options

The only setting we're changing is the choice of parsing library. The
default parsing library used is Trifecta because of its very helpful
clang-style error messages. However Trifecta requires UTF-8 compatible
input and, as mentioned above, our input file is Windows-1252 encoded.
Hence we're using Attoparsec, which has less helpful error messages but
can handle this encoding.

Benchmarking has shown that our parser is faster with attoparsec than with
trifecta, so if this is a concern to you, you might like to choose attoparsec
anyway.

\begin{code}
opts :: ParseOptions ByteString
opts = defaultParseOptions & (parsingLib .~ Attoparsec)
\end{code}

This is the type we've made for our rows. It was designed by observing
the properties of the file. Many of the fields are simply
textual data, so we've chosen ByteString. We recommend using Text if
your data is ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16. We've made data types for the other
fields.
Other fields include the ID which is an int, and several optional fields.
Because they are optional, we have wrapped them in Maybe.
These optional fields are categorical data, meaning that each entry is
from a fixed set of categories or classes.

\begin{code}
data Species =
  Species {
    taxonId :: ID
  , kingdom :: ByteString
  , clazz :: ByteString
  , family :: ByteString
  , scientificName :: ByteString
  , taxonAuthor :: ByteString
  , commonName :: ByteString
  , ncaCode:: Maybe NcaCode
  , epbcCode :: Maybe EpbcCode
  , significant :: Maybe Significance
  , endemicityCode :: Maybe Endemicity
  }
  deriving Show
\end{code}

We newtype the ID so that we don't get it mixed up with any other ints.

\begin{code}
newtype ID = ID Int deriving Show
\end{code}

Here we have our first decoder. We decode an ID by decoding an int and
then mapping the ID constructor over it. `int' is a primitive decoder
defined in Data.Sv.Decode. Typically more complex decoders are made by
combining these primitive decoders. Decoders are Applicative and
Alternative, giving us access to many derived combinators. There are also
other useful combinators defined in Data.Sv.Decode.

A FieldDecode has three type paramters. The first of these is the string
type to use for errors. Usually one would use Text or Bytestring. The second
type parameter is the input string type. We recommend these be the same.
In this case, they're both ByteString. A type alias FieldDecode' is provided,
which has these two type parameters the same. That type alias will be used for
the rest of the file. The final paramter for a FieldDecode is the type we're
decoding into.

\begin{code}
idDecode :: FieldDecode ByteString ByteString ID
idDecode = ID <$> D.int
\end{code}

This is a sum type for the different categories defined by the
Nature Conservation Act 1992. It is a simple sum type with only nullary
constructors. These are our categories...

\begin{code}
data NcaCode
  = NExtinct -- PE
  | NCriticallyEndangered -- CE
  | NEndangered -- E
  | NVulnerable -- V
  | NNearThreatened -- NT
  | NSpecialLeastConcern -- SL
  | NLeastConcern -- C
  | NInternational -- I
  | NProhibited -- P
  deriving Show
\end{code}

... and here is our decoder. We use the FieldDecode primitive `categorical',
as it makes specifying categorical data easier and provides specific error
messages when a field does not parse as any known category.

\begin{code}
nca :: FieldDecode' ByteString NcaCode
nca =
  D.categorical [
    (NExtinct, "PE")
  , (NCriticallyEndangered, "CE")
  , (NEndangered, "E")
  , (NVulnerable, "V")
  , (NNearThreatened, "NT")
  , (NSpecialLeastConcern, "SL")
  , (NLeastConcern, "C")
  , (NInternational, "I")
  , (NProhibited, "P")
  ]
\end{code}

The following are similar types and decoders, this time for categories defined
in Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and an
endemicity code. They are defined similarly to NcaCode above and its decoder.

\begin{code}
data EpbcCode
  = EExtinct -- EX
  | EWildExtinct -- WX
  | ECriticallyEndangered -- CE
  | EEndangered -- E
  | EVulnerable -- V
  | EConservationDependent -- CD
  deriving Show

epbc :: FieldDecode' ByteString EpbcCode
epbc =
  D.categorical [
    (EExtinct, "EX")
  , (EWildExtinct, "WX")
  , (ECriticallyEndangered, "CE")
  , (EEndangered, "E")
  , (EVulnerable, "V")
  , (EConservationDependent, "CD")
  ]

data Endemicity
  = QueenslandEndemic -- Q
  | AustralianEndemic -- QA
  | QldAndInternational -- QI
  | AustraliaAndInternational -- QAI
  | QldNativeUndefinedEndemicity -- U
  | NaturalisedFromOverseas -- II
  | NaturalisedFromElsewhereInAus -- IA
  | NaturalisedFromUndefinedOrigin -- IU
  | VagrantAustralian -- VA
  | VagrantInternational -- VI
  | VagrantUndefined -- VU
  deriving Show

endemicity :: FieldDecode' ByteString Endemicity
endemicity =
  D.categorical [
    (QueenslandEndemic, "Q")
  , (AustralianEndemic, "QA")
  , (QldAndInternational, "QI")
  , (AustraliaAndInternational, "QAI")
  , (QldNativeUndefinedEndemicity, "U")
  , (NaturalisedFromOverseas, "II")
  , (NaturalisedFromElsewhereInAus, "IA")
  , (NaturalisedFromUndefinedOrigin, "IU")
  , (VagrantAustralian, "VA")
  , (VagrantInternational, "VI")
  , (VagrantUndefined, "VU")
  ]
\end{code}

This is a boolean indicator of significance. We give it a categorical decoder.
This categorical decoder is different because we allow different several
different strings to indicate each of the two values. This helps to deal with
data sets with inconsistently labeled categorical data.

\begin{code}
data Significance
  = Y
  | N
  deriving Show

significance :: FieldDecode' ByteString Significance
significance =
  D.categorical' [
    (Y, ["Y", "y", "yes"])
  , (N, ["N", "n", "no"])
  ]
\end{code}

Now we put it all together! This is the decoder for our Species data type
defined above. We use our idDecode, a bunch of bytestrings, and then our
categorical decoders, each wrapped in orEmpty since they might be missing.
It's all glued together with Applicative combinators.

\begin{code}
speciesDecoder :: FieldDecode' ByteString Species
speciesDecoder = let s = D.byteString in
  Species <$> idDecode <*> s <*> s <*> s <*> s <*> s <*> s <*>
    D.orEmpty nca <*> D.orEmpty epbc <*> D.orEmpty significance <*> D.orEmpty endemicity
\end{code}

We call parseDecodeFromFile to load, parse, and decode our file. Note that we're
passing our parse options in.

\begin{code}
species :: IO (DecodeValidation ByteString [Species])
species = parseDecodeFromFile speciesDecoder opts file
\end{code}

And that's it! We've defined a data type for our rows, built a FieldDecode for
that type, and then parsed our CSV file into useful Haskell data types.

\begin{code}
main :: IO ()
main = do
  dv <- species
  case dv of
    Success rows ->
      print (length rows)
    Failure e -> do
      putStrLn "Failed to parse and decode species.csv:"
      print e
      exitFailure
\end{code}
